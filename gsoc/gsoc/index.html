Much of this work would be a fun project for someone interested in doing UI programming for the reference Mac frontend, written in Swift/Cocoa. This could involve developing new features, such as a <em>completion menu</em>, <em>status bar</em>, <em>command palette</em>, or <em>split view</em> support; there is also room for a bunch of polish, specifically around the handling of tabs and windows.</p><h3 id="Outcome"><a href="#Outcome" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor"></a>Outcome</h3><p>For the polish work, the outcome is an editing experience that reduces user frustration and fatigue. For the feature work, the outcome is an editor that is better able to support the full range of functionality expected of a modern programmer’s text editor.</p><h3 id="Difficulty"><a href="#Difficulty" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor"></a>Difficulty</h3><p>This work will be difficult in that it requires serious attention to detail, and a nitty eye for UI stuff, as well as patience in digging through documentation and sample code. It is not enormously difficult as a software engineering task, however.</p><hr/><h2 id="Language-Server-Plugin"><a href="#Language-Server-Plugin" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor"></a>Language Server Plugin</h2><h3 id="Expand-the-plugin-protocol-to-enable-fuller-featured-plugins"><a href="#Expand-the-plugin-protocol-to-enable-fuller-featured-plugins" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor"></a>Expand the plugin protocol to enable fuller featured plugins</h3><p>Xi currently has a minimal plugin API, capable of handling a small subset of possible plugin applications. We would like to expand this to support a variety of common plugin use cases, including auto-completion, displaying status information, navigating between files, and more. Specifically, we would like the plugin protocol to be capable of supporting all the features provided by the <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Language Server Protocol</a>. A final goal of this work would be to write a plugin that mediates between xi and a given language server.</p><h3 id="Outcome-1"><a href="#Outcome-1" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor"></a>Outcome</h3><p>Be able to communicate with a language server, receiving various kinds of semantic information such as hover definitions, completion suggestions, and symbol resolution.</p><h3 id="Difficulty-1"><a href="#Difficulty-1" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor"></a>Difficulty</h3><p>This is not enormously difficult technically, but will involve small modifications to numerous areas of the codebase.

A theme should be able to control all parts of the editor like gutter font, menu fonts, background colors, etc; to this end we should describe a backwards-compatible ‘textmate +’ theme format that includes more attributes. Theming is important to the usability of programming text editors.</p><h3 id="Outcome-2"><a href="#Outcome-2" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor"></a>Outcome</h3><p>When this project is finished, we will have a robust and flexible theme format, offering options suitable to a variety of UI paradigms and implementations. This should include ways of specifying colors for warnings, errors, and info lints, gutter styling, active line highlighting, and more.</p><h3 id="Difficulty-2"><a href="#Difficulty-2" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor"></a>Difficulty</h3><p>Easy to do, hard to do well. This is an important part of the editor, and a good design will be respectful of the various needs of different frontends.</p><hr/><h2 id="Theme--Syntax-Loading"><a href="#Theme--Syntax-Loading" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor"></a>Theme / Syntax Loading</h2><h3 id="Improve-the-syntax-highlighting-support-for-Xi"><a href="#Improve-the-syntax-highlighting-support-for-Xi" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor"></a>Improve the syntax highlighting support for Xi</h3><p>Xi currently uses a plugin based on <a href="https://github.com/trishume/syntect" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">syntect</a> for general theming and syntax highlighting. That plugin comes bundled with a small number of themes and syntax definitions, but there is currently no way of adding new ones. This project would add support for watching specified directories for new themes and syntax definitions, and loading them into syntect.</p><h3 id="Outcome-3"><a href="#Outcome-3" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor"></a>Outcome</h3><p>When this work is finished, the user should be able to place custom themes and syntax definitions in an appropriate place on the filesystem, and have those items automatically detected and loaded by syntect. Syntect should also generate new binary dumps including the new items, to avoid unduly impacting startup time.</p><h3 id="Difficulty-3"><a href="#Difficulty-3" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor"></a>Difficulty</h3><p>This is low-hanging fruit for core development. We already support syntax files. The work that would need to be done is to define RPC mechanism for a front-end to inform syntect of the syntax file path &amp; for syntect to integrate a filesystem watcher to scan for changes. A minimal design docs or maybe even just an Zulip discussion would be necessary. Additionally adding more syntax files built-in would improve the out-of-the box experience.</p><p>There is opportunity for the student to expand the scope of the work to improve the performance of loading the theme files by compiling them into a binary format &amp; caching them. Would require some diligence to detect stale cache entries (updated theme file) or uninstalled themes.</p><hr/><h2 id="Diff--Merge"><a href="#Diff--Merge" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor"></a>Diff / Merge</h2><h3 id="OSS-merge-could-use-a-lot-of-work"><a href="#OSS-merge-could-use-a-lot-of-work" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor"></a>OSS merge could use a lot of work</h3><p>Right now the story for merge tools, let alone native ones, isn’t particularly great. The gold standard Kdiff3 hasn’t seen very active development and suffers from a number of bugs (some related to trying to be cross-platform, some just inherent bugs in its core algorithm). Adding support for xi to act as diff/merge tool has several benefits in that it’s a simple enough operation that people might use it even before xi is ready for use as an IDE, kdiff3 provides a decent template for the UX with clear improvements that could be made. The plugin architecture for xi means that we can support different automatic diff/merge algorithms (there’s been a lot of work in this field since kdiff3 started). For Xi itself this work would flush out the ability for having multiple views to the same file which is valuable as a regular text editor. A built-in diff mechanism would also be useful from the perspective of offering the user the option to view a diff if the file contents change while there are unsaved changes (e.g. checkout).</p><h3 id="Outcome-4"><a href="#Outcome-4" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor"></a>Outcome</h3><p>Be able to open xi in 2-way diff or 3-way merge mode from git. This would require adding split-view support to a document. Xi-core supports this to some extent but there’s a bit of front-end work that would be needed to expose this (+ fix any issues within xi-core that have incorrect assumptions). Improving how alignments are managed &amp; ensuring the view doesn’t reset unnecessarily when changes are made would instantly make this a more productive tool than kdiff3 (which is saying a lot). Both mechanisms would allow for selectable diff/merge algorithm backends as there has been a lot of work in this area (semantic diff/merge, patience algorithm, etc) since kdiff3 started. Algorithms might be provided by multiple plugins.</p><h3 id="Difficulty-4"><a href="#Difficulty-4" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor"></a>Difficulty</h3><p>The split-view work should be relatively easy core development work. Diff/merge algorithms are available in several languages so it should be easy to either port it to Rust or write the diff plugin in a more expressive language like Python (at least to start). Riskier explorator work involves incorporating manual alignments into the diff/merge algorithm, which only Kdiff3 appears to have attempted, &amp; how to keep the split views consistent despite potentially radically changes to the alignments (which Kdiff3 does not do well).</p><hr/><h2 id="Workspace--Git"><a href="#Workspace--Git" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor"></a>Workspace + Git</h2><h3 id="Step-1-for-an-IDE-experience"><a href="#Step-1-for-an-IDE-experience" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor"></a>Step 1 for an IDE experience</h3><p>A workspace plugin would enable project-based editing. This would provide a foundation for performing actions like building, running &amp; debugging a target. It would also provide various higher-scope tools (e.g. refactoring) with the knowledge necessary about how to perform those actions (what files are part of the compilation, where to look for documentation, etc).
A git plugin would allow for operations like annotating lines with commit info and for viewing the diff of a particular commit. When the workspace plugin is loaded then there would also be status indications for untracked/modified status of project files.</p><h3 id="Outcome-5"><a href="#Outcome-5" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor"></a>Outcome</h3><p>A workspace plugin that supports Cargo projects so that we could self-host. Supporting CMake would be great too. This requires front-end integration as well for providing an “IDE” view.

Xi’s RPC architecture means it has to be smarter to avoid copying the full document over IPC by sending only the visible portion of a document + small deltas as changes are made. Plugins that need full document access however (code analyzer, refactoring, search tools, etc) will end up needing to maintain a copy of the full document in-process. This means that the startup time for plugins will be really slow (as the document is copied several times to serialize to JSON, write into a file descriptor, read from a file descriptor &amp; then deserialize again). Additionally, the memory usage will scale at O(mn) where m is the size of the document and n is the number of plugins which is undesirable. Additionally, some front-end features like printing still require full access to the document. Memory-mapping the buffer data offers a way to share 1 copy between all processes without any copying occuring. IPC will just need to synchronize the pointers into that buffer.</p><h3 id="Outcome-10"><a href="#Outcome-10" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor"></a>Outcome</h3><p>An MVP outcome is for the core infrastructure to store the buffer data (original file + deltas) in one or two contiguous buffers. The rope data structure would then simply reference regions into that buffer. An ideal outcome would be to also provide a mechanism for mapping those buffers into plugins/frontends, building up the rope data structure in plugins/frontends &amp; an IPC mechanism for keeping everything in-sync. A final outcome would be to come up with a good corpus of benchmarks to show the speed &amp; memory usage impact.</p><h3 id="Difficulty-10"><a href="#Difficulty-10" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor"></a>Difficulty</h3><p>This would entail a high degree of difficulty and require risky changes to a fundamental data structure. It would require altering the rope data structure to be able to have a pointer to a string slice rather than own a string itself. It would require altering the file reading code to carefully fill in buffers that have been carefully allocated on page-aligned boundaries. Editing infrastructure + ropes would have to learn how to fill a different set of memory pages that could be shared. Then, there would need to be RPC work done so that all these data structures synchronized very quickly. The final piece would be swapping out the existing buffer synchronization mechanism with the mmap piece. The existing model synchronization IPC will probably remain useful for intermachine scenarios (collaborative editing, editing remote files, etc).</p></div><div><div><p>Please, use the suggested <a href="gsoc-template.html">proposal template</a> when applying.

Much of this work would be a fun project for someone interested in doing UI programming for the reference Mac frontend, written in Swift/Cocoa. This could involve developing new features, such as a <em>completion menu</em>, <em>status bar</em>, <em>command palette</em>, or <em>split view</em> support; there is also room for a bunch of polish, specifically around the handling of tabs and windows.</p><h3 id="Outcome"><a href="#Outcome" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor"></a>Outcome</h3><p>For the polish work, the outcome is an editing experience that reduces user frustration and fatigue. For the feature work, the outcome is an editor that is better able to support the full range of functionality expected of a modern programmer’s text editor.</p><h3 id="Difficulty"><a href="#Difficulty" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor"></a>Difficulty</h3><p>This work will be difficult in that it requires serious attention to detail, and a nitty eye for UI stuff, as well as patience in digging through documentation and sample code.

We would like to expand this to support a variety of common plugin use cases, including auto-completion, displaying status information, navigating between files, and more. Specifically, we would like the plugin protocol to be capable of supporting all the features provided by the <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Language Server Protocol</a>. A final goal of this work would be to write a plugin that mediates between xi and a given language server.</p><h3 id="Outcome-1"><a href="#Outcome-1" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor"></a>Outcome</h3><p>Be able to communicate with a language server, receiving various kinds of semantic information such as hover definitions, completion suggestions, and symbol resolution.</p><h3 id="Difficulty-1"><a href="#Difficulty-1" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor"></a>Difficulty</h3><p>This is not enormously difficult technically, but will involve small modifications to numerous areas of the codebase.

A theme should be able to control all parts of the editor like gutter font, menu fonts, background colors, etc; to this end we should describe a backwards-compatible ‘textmate +’ theme format that includes more attributes. Theming is important to the usability of programming text editors.</p><h3 id="Outcome-2"><a href="#Outcome-2" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor"></a>Outcome</h3><p>When this project is finished, we will have a robust and flexible theme format, offering options suitable to a variety of UI paradigms and implementations.

That plugin comes bundled with a small number of themes and syntax definitions, but there is currently no way of adding new ones. This project would add support for watching specified directories for new themes and syntax definitions, and loading them into syntect.</p><h3 id="Outcome-3"><a href="#Outcome-3" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor"></a>Outcome</h3><p>When this work is finished, the user should be able to place custom themes and syntax definitions in an appropriate place on the filesystem, and have those items automatically detected and loaded by syntect.

We already support syntax files. The work that would need to be done is to define RPC mechanism for a front-end to inform syntect of the syntax file path &amp; for syntect to integrate a filesystem watcher to scan for changes. A minimal design docs or maybe even just an Zulip discussion would be necessary. Additionally adding more syntax files built-in would improve the out-of-the box experience.</p><p>There is opportunity for the student to expand the scope of the work to improve the performance of loading the theme files by compiling them into a binary format &amp; caching them.

The gold standard Kdiff3 hasn’t seen very active development and suffers from a number of bugs (some related to trying to be cross-platform, some just inherent bugs in its core algorithm). Adding support for xi to act as diff/merge tool has several benefits in that it’s a simple enough operation that people might use it even before xi is ready for use as an IDE, kdiff3 provides a decent template for the UX with clear improvements that could be made. The plugin architecture for xi means that we can support different automatic diff/merge algorithms (there’s been a lot of work in this field since kdiff3 started). For Xi itself this work would flush out the ability for having multiple views to the same file which is valuable as a regular text editor. A built-in diff mechanism would also be useful from the perspective of offering the user the option to view a diff if the file contents change while there are unsaved changes (e.g. checkout).</p><h3 id="Outcome-4"><a href="#Outcome-4" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor"></a>Outcome</h3><p>Be able to open xi in 2-way diff or 3-way merge mode from git. This would require adding split-view support to a document. Xi-core supports this to some extent but there’s a bit of front-end work that would be needed to expose this (+ fix any issues within xi-core that have incorrect assumptions). Improving how alignments are managed &amp; ensuring the view doesn’t reset unnecessarily when changes are made would instantly make this a more productive tool than kdiff3 (which is saying a lot). Both mechanisms would allow for selectable diff/merge algorithm backends as there has been a lot of work in this area (semantic diff/merge, patience algorithm, etc) since kdiff3 started. Algorithms might be provided by multiple plugins.</p><h3 id="Difficulty-4"><a href="#Difficulty-4" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor"></a>Difficulty</h3><p>The split-view work should be relatively easy core development work. Diff/merge algorithms are available in several languages so it should be easy to either port it to Rust or write the diff plugin in a more expressive language like Python (at least to start). Riskier explorator work involves incorporating manual alignments into the diff/merge algorithm, which only Kdiff3 appears to have attempted, &amp; how to keep the split views consistent despite potentially radically changes to the alignments (which Kdiff3 does not do well).</p><hr/><h2 id="Workspace--Git"><a href="#Workspace--Git" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor"></a>Workspace + Git</h2><h3 id="Step-1-for-an-IDE-experience"><a href="#Step-1-for-an-IDE-experience" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor"></a>Step 1 for an IDE experience</h3><p>A workspace plugin would enable project-based editing.

It would also provide various higher-scope tools (e.g. refactoring) with the knowledge necessary about how to perform those actions (what files are part of the compilation, where to look for documentation, etc).
A git plugin would allow for operations like annotating lines with commit info and for viewing the diff of a particular commit.

For example, a DSL might be written to initialize the state of the eidtor along the lines of <!-- -->[ABC)b|e(DEF]<!-- --> which would mean that the document contains the string “ABCbeDEF”, ABC is selected from A-&gt;C, there’s a cursor between b &amp; e, and DEF is selected F-&gt;D.</p><hr/><h2 id="Memory-map-text-buffers"><a href="#Memory-map-text-buffers" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor"></a>Memory map text buffers</h2><h3 id="Improve-performance-editing-large-files"><a href="#Improve-performance-editing-large-files" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor"></a>Improve performance editing large files</h3><p>A very common function for text editors is to open large files. Xi’s RPC architecture means it has to be smarter to avoid copying the full document over IPC by sending only the visible portion of a document + small deltas as changes are made. Plugins that need full document access however (code analyzer, refactoring, search tools, etc) will end up needing to maintain a copy of the full document in-process. This means that the startup time for plugins will be really slow (as the document is copied several times to serialize to JSON, write into a file descriptor, read from a file descriptor &amp; then deserialize again). Additionally, the memory usage will scale at O(mn) where m is the size of the document and n is the number of plugins which is undesirable. Additionally, some front-end features like printing still require full access to the document. Memory-mapping the buffer data offers a way to share 1 copy between all processes without any copying occuring. IPC will just need to synchronize the pointers into that buffer.</p><h3 id="Outcome-10"><a href="#Outcome-10" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor"></a>Outcome</h3><p>An MVP outcome is for the core infrastructure to store the buffer data (original file + deltas) in one or two contiguous buffers. The rope data structure would then simply reference regions into that buffer. An ideal outcome would be to also provide a mechanism for mapping those buffers into plugins/frontends, building up the rope data structure in plugins/frontends &amp; an IPC mechanism for keeping everything in-sync. A final outcome would be to come up with a good corpus of benchmarks to show the speed &amp; memory usage impact.</p><h3 id="Difficulty-10"><a href="#Difficulty-10" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor"></a>Difficulty</h3><p>This would entail a high degree of difficulty and require risky changes to a fundamental data structure. It would require altering the rope data structure to be able to have a pointer to a string slice rather than own a string itself. It would require altering the file reading code to carefully fill in buffers that have been carefully allocated on page-aligned boundaries. Editing infrastructure + ropes would have to learn how to fill a different set of memory pages that could be shared. Then, there would need to be RPC work done so that all these data structures synchronized very quickly. The final piece would be swapping out the existing buffer synchronization mechanism with the mmap piece. The existing model synchronization IPC will probably remain useful for intermachine scenarios (collaborative editing, editing remote files, etc).</p></div></div></div></section></div></div></main></div></div></div><script id="gatsby-script-loader">/*<![CDATA[*/window.page={"componentChunkName":"component---cache-gatsby-mdx-mdx-wrappers-dir-248-e-51405-d-8-ad-0-e-8-ff-1-a-314-a-5-b-224-cc-0-scope-hash-3010-b-3-badc-54-a-9-dfa-4-a-4-c-80-e-419-a-41-b-2-js","jsonName":"gsoc-gsoc-49c","path":"/gsoc/gsoc/"};window.dataPath="622/path---gsoc-gsoc-49-c-837-tobz6bZqWptkS2FSnEiHWaivy8w";/*]]>*/</script><script id="gatsby-chunk-mapping">/*<![CDATA[*/window.___chunkMapping={"app":["/app-46f25a4e0bb303c5d58f.js"],"component---node-modules-gatsby-plugin-offline-app-shell-js":["/component---node-modules-gatsby-plugin-offline-app-shell-js-5bf3dc2c26ecbd63fbd0.js"],"component---src-templates-blog-list-js":["/component---src-templates-blog-list-js-68e29daae0f560473896.js"],"component---cache-gatsby-mdx-mdx-wrappers-dir-d-95-ab-767-d-696-bb-926-c-5-d-1-d-8-ce-389204-d-scope-hash-3010-b-3-badc-54-a-9-dfa-4-a-4-c-80-e-419-a-41-b-2-js":["/component---cache-gatsby-mdx-mdx-wrappers-dir-d-95-ab-767-d-696-bb-926-c-5-d-1-d-8-ce-389204-d-scope-hash-3010-b-3-badc-54-a-9-dfa-4-a-4-c-80-e-419-a-41-b-2-js-3cce64ab6ad8a00f8053.js"],"component---cache-gatsby-mdx-mdx-wrappers-dir-6-a-6-d-7612520-aff-73-cb-56-c-0-b-39-c-2-af-0-be-scope-hash-3010-b-3-badc-54-a-9-dfa-4-a-4-c-80-e-419-a-41-b-2-js":["/component---cache-gatsby-mdx-mdx-wrappers-dir-6-a-6-d-7612520-aff-73-cb-56-c-0-b-39-c-2-af-0-be-scope-hash-3010-b-3-badc-54-a-9-dfa-4-a-4-c-80-e-419-a-41-b-2-js-96b730ebcfd9805849e8.js"],"component---cache-gatsby-mdx-mdx-wrappers-dir-248-e-51405-d-8-ad-0-e-8-ff-1-a-314-a-5-b-224-cc-0-scope-hash-3010-b-3-badc-54-a-9-dfa-4-a-4-c-80-e-419-a-41-b-2-js":["/component---cache-gatsby-mdx-mdx-wrappers-dir-248-e-51405-d-8-ad-0-e-8-ff-1-a-314-a-5-b-224-cc-0-scope-hash-3010-b-3-badc-54-a-9-dfa-4-a-4-c-80-e-419-a-41-b-2-js-b8d3395483f2c4f148de.js"],"component---src-pages-404-js":["/component---src-pages-404-js-db6cd2ae89009ad1afcd.js"],"component---src-pages-building-docs-js":["/component---src-pages-building-docs-js-d39a25107e95f1a6f7cc.js"],"component---src-pages-contribute-js":["/component---src-pages-contribute-js-c18274c924e984ba4a11.js"],"component---src-pages-index-js":["/component---src-pages-index-js-ed28e9cd9567f298d21d.js"]};/*]]>*/</script><script src="/xi-editor-gatsby/webpack-runtime-e180f5e508da91797d79.js" async=""></script><script src="/xi-editor-gatsby/0-3058d9943b60ad518acf.js" async=""></script><script src="/xi-editor-gatsby/app-46f25a4e0bb303c5d58f.js" async=""></script><script src="/xi-editor-gatsby/component---cache-gatsby-mdx-mdx-wrappers-dir-248-e-51405-d-8-ad-0-e-8-ff-1-a-314-a-5-b-224-cc-0-scope-hash-3010-b-3-badc-54-a-9-dfa-4-a-4-c-80-e-419-a-41-b-2-js-b8d3395483f2c4f148de.js" async=""></script><script src="/xi-editor-gatsby/1-6e57b76f82a78bcb777f.js" async=""></script></body></html>
