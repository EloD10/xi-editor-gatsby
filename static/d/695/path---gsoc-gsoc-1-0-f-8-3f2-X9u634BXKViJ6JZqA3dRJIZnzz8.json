Xi’s RPC architecture means it has to be smarter to avoid copying the full document over IPC by sending only the visible portion of a document + small deltas as changes are made. Plugins that need full document access however (code analyzer, refactoring, search tools, etc) will end up needing to maintain a copy of the full document in-process. This means that the startup time for plugins will be really slow (as the document is copied several times to serialize to JSON, write into a file descriptor, read from a file descriptor & then deserialize again). Additionally, the memory usage will scale at O(mn) where m is the size of the document and n is the number of plugins which is undesirable. Additionally, some front-end features like printing still require full access to the document.

It would require altering the rope data structure to be able to have a pointer to a string slice rather than own a string itself. It would require altering the file reading code to carefully fill in buffers that have been carefully allocated on page-aligned boundaries. Editing infrastructure + ropes would have to learn how to fill a different set of memory pages that could be shared. Then, there would need to be RPC work done so that all these data structures synchronized very quickly. The final piece would be swapping out the existing buffer synchronization mechanism with the mmap piece. The existing model synchronization IPC will probably remain useful for intermachine scenarios (collaborative editing, editing remote files, etc).`));\n});"},"excerpt":"Please, use the suggested  proposal template  when applying.
