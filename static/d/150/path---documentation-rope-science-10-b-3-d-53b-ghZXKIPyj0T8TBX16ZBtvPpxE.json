In this model, instead of each insert being annotated with just a unique id of the actor, it's annotated with a tuple of (priority, unique id). We can sort these in lexicographical order, so the CRDT goal of ensuring a consistent order is still met. But by assigning appropriate priorities, we can now get the edits in the correct order. In particular, give \"....\" the priority \"before cursor\", \"bar\" the priority \"just before cursor\" (which is the default priority of all characters inserted from the keyboard), and \"\\n\" the priority \"after cursor\". Insert all of these strings at the same location, and voila, you get the desired answer. Further, you can include the cursor position itself in the ordering logic, resulting in it naturally landing after \"bar\" without it having to be explicitly positioned.
