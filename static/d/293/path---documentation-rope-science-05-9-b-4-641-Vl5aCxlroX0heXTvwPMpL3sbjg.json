Most of the time, those boundaries line up pretty well with the line break boundaries, but not always. For one, the width boundaries are highly dependent on the font. At one extreme, in a monospace font, per-character is completely fine. On the other hand, if the font allows space to participate in kerning (or contextual substitutions) then your calculation will be off. This will happen in a high-quality Urdu (Nastaliq) font.
