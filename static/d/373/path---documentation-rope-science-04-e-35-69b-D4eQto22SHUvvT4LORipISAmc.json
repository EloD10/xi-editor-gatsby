In principle, you have to do the computation twice for both cases, whether the first line is a comment or not, but in practice it doesn’t make the computation any more expensive: you compute (t, m) for the first line and for the rest of the string, and just store both the first value and the monoid sum.`), React.createElement(MDXTag, {\n      name: \"p\",\n      components: components\n    }, `The same tricks extend without too much difficulty to a real language like C++; there are more cases but the lexical language for comments and quoted strings tends not to be too complicated.

To deal with mismatched parens (which are usually going to be an error of some kind), I think what you want to do is retrieve the local neighborhood of each of your matches, then you can easily tell just from the character whether it’s matched or not.
