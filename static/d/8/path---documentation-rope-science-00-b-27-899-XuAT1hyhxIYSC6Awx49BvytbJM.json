I had always intended to publish these after some cleanup and polishing, but never got around to it.</p>\n<p>For the curious and persistent, here are the original posts, with a bit of light editing and context (including cherry-picks from ensuing discussion). They will probably be helpful to understand xi internals, but don't take the place of real documentation. That said, these posts can hopefully provide input for that documentation, and may be interesting on their own.</p>\n<p>I don't think I ever wrote a part 7. It was supposed to be about spans and interval trees, still a very interesting topic.</p>\n<p>Enjoy!</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Rope science - Introduction"}},"allMarkdownRemark":{"edges":[{"node":{"id":"159ebaf9-aed2-5ad5-b403-f0a2c391cbef","fields":{"slug":"/frontend-notes/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Notes on writing front-ends"}}},{"node":{"id":"db31e77f-3fda-57fc-9830-61c9f7c222dd","fields":{"slug":"/frontend-protocol/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"The Frontend Protocol"}}},{"node":{"id":"e81dd02d-d53d-5928-978d-37b7a16cdb61","fields":{"slug":"/plugin/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Plugin architecture"}}},{"node":{"id":"056635a4-9cff-573b-9253-1c2afd68ff96","fields":{"slug":"/config/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Working with the config system"}}},{"node":{"id":"ef83d327-af33-537c-b865-304c9cbd7567","fields":{"slug":"/crdt/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"CRDT - An approach to async plugins and undo"}}},{"node":{"id":"e7b10047-5613-53ea-bdeb-3989cfe8ac10","fields":{"slug":"/crdt-details/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"CRDT - The Xi Text Engine"}}},{"node":{"id":"8493f667-6117-50a0-bc92-21f304190a9f","fields":{"slug":"/fuchsia-ledger-crdts/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"CRDT - Using the Ledger for CRDTs"}}},{"node":{"id":"637adc80-f545-583f-b103-0e6256f0efe1","fields":{"slug":"/rope-science-00/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Rope science - Introduction"}}},{"node":{"id":"d6abbbb0-ce0b-5810-8ab1-40db5f8fbb4d","fields":{"slug":"/rope-science-01/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Rope science, part 1 - MapReduce for text"}}},{"node":{"id":"0b56a298-7fea-52be-b0c1-1924e8de94df","fields":{"slug":"/rope-science-02/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Rope science, part 2 - metrics"}}},{"node":{"id":"f3d25a72-d849-52f7-8fb4-6d586db9b401","fields":{"slug":"/rope-science-03/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Rope science, part 3 - Grapheme cluster boundaries"}}},{"node":{"id":"ed9dc1bf-9c35-58a0-b8ed-e702bdbc974f","fields":{"slug":"/rope-science-04/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Rope science, part 4 - parenthesis matching"}}},{"node":{"id":"e3b3971e-a314-5c04-adc0-30c2e2f21345","fields":{"slug":"/rope-science-05/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Rope science, part 5 - incremental word wrapping"}}},{"node":{"id":"271d1a9b-90e4-5315-b138-2a02a017e117","fields":{"slug":"/rope-science-06/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Rope science, part 6 - parallel and asynchronous word wrapping"}}},{"node":{"id":"ef5e3b38-01da-5a9c-ad36-fce16dacff86","fields":{"slug":"/rope-science-08/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Rope science, part 8 - CRDTs for concurrent editing"}}},{"node":{"id":"b73f0ca0-d039-531c-91a7-b8d0893fc5e8","fields":{"slug":"/rope-science-08a/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Rope science, part 8a - CRDT follow-up"}}},{"node":{"id":"0c5f285f-2a9b-589f-8eff-a79435e54257","fields":{"slug":"/rope-science-09/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Rope science, part 9 - CRDT Approach to Async Plugins and Undo"}}},{"node":{"id":"ef95af30-321f-5d87-a5e3-720e4eff00f9","fields":{"slug":"/rope-science-10/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Rope science, part 10 - designing for a conflict-free world"}}},{"node":{"id":"4dd8698d-d45f-543c-9905-eba9659b68b0","fields":{"slug":"/rope-science-11/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Rope science, part 11 - practical syntax highlighting"}}},{"node":{"id":"c8b885e6-57e4-5e66-9651-7b47f528793d","fields":{"slug":"/rope-science-12/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Rope science, part 12 - minimal invalidation"}}}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"637adc80-f545-583f-b103-0e6256f0efe1"}}
