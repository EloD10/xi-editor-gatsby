So when you look at two snapshots, it's got some cells filled in common, some cells filled only in one, and some cells filled only in the other.

The coordinate exactly at that point is an interesting case, but I think the best way to approach it is tie-breaking based on the identity of who made the insert.

The straightforward way (deleting the sequence from the buffer, trying to do the same kind of coordinate transform, this time subtracting the length of the deleted subsequence) ruins commutativity. In fact, the whole model falls apart, making OT fiendishly complex and messy. The key insight of CRDT is that you can get back a monotonic update operation if you give each cell three states: empty, filled, and deleted, and each update progresses only forward through these states. In mathematical terms, this is a monotonic semi-lattice again. In a concrete implementation, you keep the spans around in your shared state, but mark them as deleted (these are known as \"tombstones\"), and of course do the deletion before actually rendering to the screen.`), React.createElement(MDXTag, {\n      name: \"p\",\n      components: components\n    }, `Optionally, you can add some form of garbage collection to clean up the removed spans. In an editor, it's reasonable to assume that the amount of concurrency is very small. In fact, in most normal operation the buffer will often quiesce (no pending edits), at which point in the simplest case you can just delete out the spans. In practice, I suspect we'll need to keep some of the deleted spans around for undo (if you undo a delete, you really want the deleted text to appear in the same place relative to its context), but in even so I expect the number of edits in flight will be small enough you can use really simple algorithms.
